# Teaching

I have primarily taught networking classes during my career, with a
few forays into social networking and Western Civilization. My
responsibilities are changing, and I will now be teaching security
and web programming courses.

I strive to keep all my class materials available online, including
syllabi, assignments, and code.

My current assignments:

<u>CS 260 Web Programming</u>: Web Programming, including both front end and
back end code. The primary language used will be JavaScript, along
with HTML and CSS for formatting. The back end code will use Node.js
and a SQL database. By the end of the class you should feel
comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, SQL
databases, and a front-end framework. I currently use Vue.js for the
front end. *I don't have these materials online yet, but will be
working on this.*

[CS 465 Computer Security](https://cs465.internet.byu.edu):
Fundamental principles of computer security, including cryptography,
systems, and software security.

[CS 665 Advanced Computer Security](https://cs665.internet.byu.edu):
This graduate course explores advanced topics in computer security. We
cover some classic papers and mostly current papers from major
security conferences.


## Mentoring

I often mentor undergraduate students interested in working on
research projects. We can now offer credit for a semester of
undergraduate research, and often have funding to pay students as
well. In past semesters I mentored students on open source projects,
including the Secure Socket API (https://securesocketapi.org), the
20 Minute Genealogist project (now [Kinpoint](http://kinpoint.com)), [leaf](http://leaf.byu.edu) and
[Citizen Budget](http://citizenbudget.org).

## Past Classes

[CS 360 Internet Programming](https://cs360.byu.edu):
Internet application programming, including client-server and web
applications. Sockets, concurrency, thread-pool and event-driven
architectures, experimental performance evaluation, web database
application design, security issues. C++, Python, CSS, Javascript.

[CS 460 Computer Communications and Networking](https://cs460.byu.edu): Introductory course in networking
for undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Focuses on
understanding how the Internet works, from the application layer down
to the link layer. Application-layer networking, transport protocols
(TCP and UDP), routing protocols, IP, link-level protocols, wireless
networking, and multimedia networking.

[CS 660 Computer Networks](https://cs660.byu.edu): This
graduate course explores advanced topics in computer networks,
focusing on fundamental research being conducted to improve the
Internet. Topics include applications, routing, transport, wireless,
measurements and other Internet research areas.

[CS 601 Special Topics](http://ilab.cs.byu.edu/cs601): Graduate
courses on [Advanced Operating Systems](https://cs601.internet.byu.edu/fall-2017/)
[Usability Research](https://wiki.cs.byu.edu/cs-601r-usability/start)
[Social Networking](http://ilab.cs.byu.edu/cs601/2013w)
[Wireless Mesh Networks](http://ilab.cs.byu.edu/cs601/2010w) and
[Peer-to-Peer Networking](http://ilab.cs.byu.edu/cs601/2005w).

[Digital Civilization](http://digitalcivilization.blogspot.com/2010/08/welcome-to-class.html):
Honors 202 Western Civilization 2, co-taught with Gideon Burton in the
English department in Fall 2010 and Winter 2012. Teaches western
civilization from our current perspective in the digital
revolution. The course emphasizes self-directed learning and the use
of digital media (blogging, social bookmarking, social networking) to
understand and relate to the history of Western civilization.
