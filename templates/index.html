# Research

I direct the [Usable Security and Privacy Lab](http://internet.byu.edu). Some of our
research is done jointly with the [Internet Security Research
Lab](http://isrl.byu.edu), led by Kent Seamons. In the past, I
conducted research in networking, including multicast routing,
peer-to-peer networking, and wireless routing and transport
protocols. As a graduate student I was lucky enough to be a part of
the RSVP project. I occasionally do some measurement work. See my
[research page](/research) and my [publications page](/publications)
for more details.

# Teaching

For many years I have taught courses in Computer Networking and
Internet Programming. Recently I have begun teaching Web Programming
and Computer Security. See my [teaching page](/teaching) for more details.

# Research Artifacts

I believe that all scientists should publish their research artifacts
with every publication. This includes releasing source code,
documentation, data, scripts, user-study guides, survey text, and so
forth. We strive to provide all materials needed to replicate our
research whenever we publish a paper. I believe creating open source
software -- both in my research and in service to the community -- is
at the heart of [BYU's
mission](http://aims.byu.edu/p/missionstatement).

# Professional and Community Service

I currently serve the program committees for USENIX Security. In the past I have served as the publicity chair for ACSAC, workshop coordinator for SOUPS, and served on the program committees for PETS, CCS and ACSAC. I have also chaired the BYU Family History
Technology Workshop.

I served on the planning commission and city council of [Cedar
Hills](http://cedarhills.org) for a combined seven years. I also spent
several years on the board of the Lone Peak Public Safety District and
Utah Valley Dispatch. If you are interested in serving
politically, I would be happy to talk to you about it.
