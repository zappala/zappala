# Hiring Undergraduate Research Assistants, Summer 2020

I'm interesting in hiring undergraduates to conduct research this summer. I am
willing to hire at all experience levels -- I can provide training to help you
to contribute to a research project. Pay is at $10-$15 per hour, depending on experience.

**To apply, send me an email with your resume at zappala@cs.byu.edu.**
In your email, tell me which CS classes you are taking this semester and
any you have planned over spring/summer. I will give preference to those
available for full-time work who are not taking classes during spring/summer.

Much of our research involves building new systems. Other parts include running
usability studies, which requires coordinating an experiment with people to try
our new software (sometimes on campus, sometimes remote), running statistical
analysis, and analyzing qualitative data.

I'm willing to train and mentor you in a number of roles:

* systems development, including interacting with kernel modules, cryptography,
sockets, event handling, etc. (C programming language)

* app development for a new login system to replace passwords, including a mobile
app and a desktop app or browser extension (Go, Dart/Flutter, and JavaScript)

* running usability studies, including statistical analysis using R

The two projects we'll be working on are:

## Let's Authenticate

We are developing two new systems to replace passwords for login to websites.
This will involve systems development and then usability studies. We currently have
a partially working mobile app and a supporting server written. Read more in

## The Secure Socket API

We are developing a system to make it much easier to create secure connections
between programs. We already have working code but are needing to get it to
a more mature state, essentially a well-supported open source system. This
involves learning how OpenSSL works and then improving our code in a variety of
ways. Read more at this site:
